name: deliver-ready-issue
description: Deliver a dependency-ready sumika GitHub Issue through a bounded implementation workflow in an isolated worktree lane. Use when asked to implement, publish, or land a specific ready Issue, to take the next explicitly approved frontier item through verification and review, or to run several ready Issues as parallel lanes.

# Deliver Ready Issue

Take one approved Issue from readiness check to the highest delivery stage the
user authorized. Keep the Issue as planning truth and the Pull Request as
implementation truth. A pasted Issue reference is context, not authority to
publish or to widen the task.

One run of this Skill is one delivery lane: one Issue, one claim branch
`<type>/<issue>` on GitHub, one worktree, one Pull Request, one owner. Claims
live on GitHub because lanes may run on different machines; worktrees only
isolate lanes that share a machine. To deliver several ready Issues at once,
the lead follows [references/parallel-delivery.md](references/parallel-delivery.md)
and runs this Skill once per lane. [scripts/issue-lane.sh](scripts/issue-lane.sh)
inspects, claims, and releases a lane deterministically.

## Establish the authority ceiling

Infer the ceiling from the user's explicit request. When it is unclear, choose
the lower ceiling and state what remains:

- **Implement**: change the local working tree and verify it.
- **Publish**: implement, commit, push, and open a ready Pull Request.
- **Land**: publish, resolve review and CI, then merge and clean up.

Permission for a higher stage includes its preceding stages. It never includes
unrelated issue creation, prioritization, assignment, release publication,
force-pushing protected branches, or weakening repository protections.

## Deliver the Issue

### 1. Prove readiness

1. Resolve the exact repository and Issue. If the user asks for the "next"
   Issue, require an explicit selection or a recommendation produced by
   `advance-issue-frontier` before starting.
2. Read the repository instructions, the Issue, linked decisions, and the live
   Pull Request and Issue state.
3. Read `## GitHub dependencies` literally. Treat an open predecessor or an
   unresolved non-Issue dependency as blocking.
4. Check the claim state on GitHub, the only state other machines share:

   ```sh
   bash .agents/skills/deliver-ready-issue/scripts/issue-lane.sh check <issue>
   ```

   It reports open Pull Requests referencing the Issue, claim branches
   (`<type>/<issue>`, `*/<issue>-*`), assignees with the assignment age, and
   a verdict; exit code 3 is `claimed`. A claim means another lane owns the
   Issue: continue only when the user directs the takeover, and preserve the
   existing branch, Pull Request, and evidence first. An assignment older than
   six hours without branch or Pull Request is reported as a hint; ask the
   maintainer before claiming. Then inspect this machine with
   `git worktree list --porcelain` and `git branch --list '*/<issue>*'`; a
   local lane for the Issue is somebody's isolation, not yours.
5. Confirm that the Issue is open, unblocked, focused enough for one Pull
   Request, and has testable acceptance criteria.

Stop without creating a branch when readiness, ownership, or dependencies are
ambiguous. Report the smallest action that would unblock delivery.

### 2. Isolate the work

1. Inspect `git status -sb` and `git worktree list`. Preserve every unrelated
   change, branch, worktree, and running process. Never switch, reset, stash,
   or clean the primary checkout or another lane's worktree.
2. Claim the Issue on GitHub before implementing, under Publish or Land
   authority or an explicit claim authorization:

   ```sh
   bash .agents/skills/deliver-ready-issue/scripts/issue-lane.sh claim <issue>
   ```

   The script derives `<type>` from the Issue, creates `<type>/<issue>` on
   GitHub from the default branch with an atomic ref creation, assigns you, and
   prints the branch and base SHA. Exit code 3 means another machine claimed
   first: stop and report; do not create a differently named branch. Under an
   Implement-only ceiling, do not claim; state in the report that the Issue
   stays unclaimed and invisible to other machines, or ask for claim
   authority first.
3. Check the claim branch out in the lane worktree and confirm the base SHA:

   ```sh
   git fetch --prune origin
   git worktree add --track -b <type>/<issue> .worktrees/issue-<issue> origin/<type>/<issue>
   git -C .worktrees/issue-<issue> rev-parse HEAD
   ```

   On a machine without an existing checkout, a fresh clone on the claim branch
   is the lane worktree. Do all further work inside it. If the worktree already
   exists, another lane on this machine owns it; return to step 1.4.
4. When other lanes are active on the machine, serialize shared Git mutations:
   `fetch --prune`, worktree creation or removal, local branch deletion, and
   merges happen one at a time and never while a sibling lane runs them.
   Committing and publishing your own branch from your own worktree is not a
   shared mutation.

Never discard, overwrite, stash, or commit unrelated work merely to obtain a
clean tree, and never reuse a worktree for a different Issue. Beyond the
branch and the assignment the script creates, do not comment on or otherwise
mark the Issue unless documented maintainer policy requires it.

### 3. Bound the implementation

1. Run `assess-change-impact` against the Issue and affected paths.
2. Translate the Issue acceptance criteria into code, test, documentation,
   migration, configuration, and security obligations.
3. Implement one coherent outcome. Avoid opportunistic cleanup.
4. If the Issue cannot produce one reviewable Pull Request, stop and recommend
   a split. Do not create follow-up Issues without authorization.

### 4. Verify and review

1. Add focused deterministic tests while implementing.
2. Run `verify-change` for intermediate local evidence and retain exact
   commands, results, skips, and remaining uncertainty. Carry its evidence
   state, review disposition, baseline and candidate identities, root-cause/
   sibling analysis, and any freshness limitation forward. Dirty-worktree
   results are not the final PR proof.
   A `review-required` disposition may coexist with `validated` evidence; do
   not mark it `review-complete` or `merged` by assertion.
3. Run **`autoreview` before committing**. Do **not** vendor the helper into
   this repo; resolve it from the shared skill install (see `AGENTS.md`
   Closeout). Fix actionable findings and rerun the relevant checks until no
   material finding remains or a documented blocker requires maintainer
   judgment.
4. Inspect the final diff for scope, generated artifacts, secrets, and
   accidental runtime state.

### 5. Publish when authorized

1. Stage only the intended paths and create a narrow imperative commit.
   Never use `--no-gpg-sign`. If signing fails, stop and fix GPG.
   Immediately before publishing, run `git fetch --prune origin` and
   `git merge-base --is-ancestor origin/main HEAD`. If the check fails, refresh
   the branch onto `main` and rerun the affected checks. Otherwise refresh only
   for a failing gate, an explicit request, or a sibling lane that landed on a
   shared surface (`sumika-protocol`, the PTY supervisor, attach exclusivity,
   or the Unix socket path). Do not rebase merely because `main` advanced.
2. Run `verify-change` again against the committed candidate before publishing.
   Require the full candidate SHA, clean-content guard, exact proof, and the
   appropriate review disposition. If this final verification or any review
   fix changes content, repeat review, commit, and final verification before
   continuing. The PR must carry this immutable candidate evidence.
3. Publish to the claim branch. If `scripts/gh-verified-push.sh` exists, use
   it (GraphQL `createCommitOnBranch`) so GitHub shows Verified:
   - Claim branch (already exists on GitHub):
     `scripts/gh-verified-push.sh --branch <type>/<issue> --sync-local`
   - A branch that does not exist yet (no claim was possible):
     `scripts/gh-verified-push.sh --create-branch-from origin/main --branch <type>/<issue> --sync-local`
   - Confirm the script reports `verification.verified=true` and that the
     hosted tree matches local `HEAD`.
   Otherwise `git push -u origin HEAD`. Never use `--no-gpg-sign`.
4. After `--sync-local` moves the branch to the server-created commit, record
   that new full SHA and run `verify-change` against it. Require a clean
   content guard and exact candidate evidence before opening the PR. If
   post-publish verification fails, do not open or land the PR; fix from the
   synced branch and repeat review, publish, and post-publish verification.
5. Open the Pull Request as a draft with the first published commit, then mark
   it ready once verification and review are complete and `mergeable` is no
   longer `UNKNOWN` (`gh pr ready <pr>`). The Pull Request:
   - closes the Issue with a visible `Closes #<issue>` line;
   - carries the lane brief: agent, machine, base SHA, authority ceiling;
   - summarizes behavior rather than file operations;
   - lists verification evidence and any skipped checks;
   - calls out configuration, compatibility, migration, and security impact;
   - includes an agent transcript when the project workflow requires it.
6. Return the Pull Request URL. Do not publish when the ceiling is Implement.

### 6. Land when authorized

1. Wait for required CI and review. Resolve actionable feedback in the same
   branch and rerun affected checks. Re-publish review fixes with
   `scripts/gh-verified-push.sh` when present, otherwise `git push`, so the
   PR tip stays current.
2. Recheck that dependencies and repository protections still permit landing.
   Land one lane at a time; wait for a sibling lane's merge to finish and
   recheck `mergeable` before starting yours.
3. Prefer squash merge for Verified linear history on `main`:
   `gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch`.
   Use `--match-head-commit` with the published tip when available. Do not use
   GitHub rebase-merge when Verified commits matter. A failed or timed-out
   merge response may still have merged; reconcile the remote Pull Request
   state and `main` ancestry before retrying.
4. Confirm the Issue closed and the default branch contains the merge. The
   merge deleted the claim branch and the closed Issue ends the claim; the
   assignment stays as history. Then remove the local lane, serialized with
   other shared Git mutations:

   ```sh
   git worktree remove .worktrees/issue-<issue>
   git branch -D <type>/<issue>
   git worktree prune
   ```

   Squash merges are invisible to `git branch --merged`; confirm the landing
   with `gh pr view <pr> --json state,mergeCommit` before deleting. Leave the
   primary checkout untouched unless the user asks to synchronize it. A lane
   that is abandoned before publishing releases its claim with
   `bash .agents/skills/deliver-ready-issue/scripts/issue-lane.sh release <issue>`,
   which refuses to delete a branch with
   commits or an open Pull Request unless told to.
5. Invoke `advance-issue-frontier` in report-only mode unless the user also
   authorized frontier status updates.

Never enable auto-merge, bypass checks, relax protection, or merge beyond the
authority ceiling.

## Report completion

Return:

- Issue and authority ceiling;
- claim state (claimed, unclaimed under Implement, or taken over), machine and
  worktree, branch, base SHA, final commit, and Pull Request when created;
- implemented outcome;
- verification evidence state, review disposition, delivery status, exact
  baseline/candidate identities, and remaining uncertainty;
- verification and review evidence;
- merge state and newly available follow-up work when applicable;
- blockers, skipped checks, and remaining uncertainty.

## Boundaries

- Deliver only the selected Issue; do not choose project priority.
- Do not implement blocked work or infer that silence grants ownership.
- Work only inside your lane worktree. Never switch, reset, stash, or clean the
  primary checkout or another lane's worktree, and never delete a worktree or
  branch you do not own.
- Never work around a lost claim race with a differently named branch, a
  forced ref update, or by removing another lane's assignment.
- Keep secrets, credentials, logs, databases, and runtime state out of Git.
- Do not substitute a successful build for Issue acceptance evidence.
- Do not close an Issue manually when the implementation has not landed.
