description: Shape a raw sumika idea, bug report, refactoring proposal, or research question into a focused GitHub Issue. Use when work needs scope, acceptance evidence, risk routing, or the correct Issue template before implementation.

# Shape Work Item

Turn intent into a decision-ready unit of work. Produce a draft unless the user
explicitly authorizes publishing to GitHub.

## Procedure

1. Read `AGENTS.md`, `VISION.md`, `CONTEXT.md`,
   `docs/decisions/0001-week0.md`, and the matching form under
   `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`. Inspect affected code or docs when named.
   Complete when the request is framed against actual project boundaries
   (no panes, no screen scrape, steal not share).
2. Search open and closed Issues, Discussions, and PRs when GitHub access is
   available. Record possible duplicates or state that the search was not run.
   Complete when overlapping work is linked or ruled out.
3. Classify the work:
   - `bug`: reproducible expected-versus-actual behavior;
   - `feature`: a new observable operator or integration outcome;
   - `refactor`: preserved behavior with concrete structural evidence; or
   - `research`: a time-boxed question that ends in a decision.
   Route sensitive/exploitable behavior to `SECURITY.md`. Route cross-boundary,
   public-contract, trust-model, or difficult-to-reverse choices to a Design
   Discussion before implementation. Complete when exactly one primary route
   is selected and exceptions are explained.
4. Draft the work item with a problem statement, observable outcome, non-goals,
   acceptance evidence, affected boundary (daemon/PTY, attach/steal/detach,
   CLI, protocol, hooks/report, docs), and compatibility/security risks.
   Preserve uncertainty as an explicit question. Complete when another
   contributor can tell what success means without reconstructing the prompt.
5. Recommend one type label, one status label, relevant area/risk labels, and
   whether a milestone is justified. Do not invent priority, assignment, or a
   milestone. Complete when every recommended label describes supplied
   evidence.

## Output

Return:

1. route and rationale;
2. possible duplicates or search limitation;
3. issue title and body ready for the selected form;
4. recommended labels; and
5. unresolved questions that prevent `status:ready`.

Keep implementation design out of the Issue unless it is a validated
constraint. Do not publish, assign, close, or prioritize GitHub work without
explicit authorization.
